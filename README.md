# Pannalingo (WIP)

A native android application that uses notifications with direct replies to quiz the user on foreign vocabulary.
It's difficult to muster the discipline to open an app/book/whatever, so the intention of this is to bring the words to the user without the effort.

## Features:
- Quizzing through notifications with direct replies or reminder notifications
- Rates how well the user hits the mark on answers and adjusts the frequency of certain words accordingly
- Set the quizzing frequency (hourly, bi-hourly, etc.)
- Add words manually OR mass import words with Excel, CSV, etc.
  - Nice to have: Import words from Duolingo
  - Nice to have: Create sets of words to quiz

## Mockup:
